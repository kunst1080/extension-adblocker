# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools like Canva.

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create your own icons, you can use placeholder icons from various sources:

1. Material Design Icons: https://material.io/resources/icons/
2. Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/
3. Flaticon: https://www.flaticon.com/

## Icon Requirements

- Icons should be in PNG format
- Icons should have transparent backgrounds
- The main icon content should be centered
- For best results, use a simple, recognizable design that works well at small sizes

## Example Icon Design

For an ad blocker extension, consider using a shield icon, a crossed-out ad symbol, or a stop sign to represent the blocking functionality.
